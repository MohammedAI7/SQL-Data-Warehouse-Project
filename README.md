# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

As a Machine Learning engineer 🤖 with a keen interest in understanding how data flows through real-world systems and how engineers use SQL for managing and preparing data, I created this project to strengthen my SQL skills 🧠 and gain a deeper understanding of data warehousing and analytics 📊.

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

This project uses the **Medallion Architecture**, which organizes data into three layers:

- **Bronze Layer:** Raw data collected directly from source systems (CSV files) is stored in SQL Server without changes.
- **Silver Layer:** This layer handles data cleaning, standardization, and transformation to prepare it for analysis.
- **Gold Layer:** Final business-ready data is organized using a **Star Schema** model for reporting and analytics.

## 📖 Project Overview

Here’s what the project includes:

- **Data Architecture:** Setting up a modern warehouse using Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
- **ETL Pipelines:** Extracting, transforming, and loading data from CSV files into the SQL Server.
- **Data Modeling:** Creating fact and dimension tables designed for analytical queries.
- **Analytics & Reporting:** Building simple SQL-based reports and dashboards to extract insights.

## 🎯 Skills Practiced

This project helped me learn and improve in:

- Writing and understanding **SQL**
- Basics of **Data Architecture**
- Building **ETL pipelines**
- **Data Modeling** using star schema
- Creating simple **analytical reports**

## 🛠️ Tools & Resources Used

All tools used in this project are free:

- **CSV Datasets:** Provided as source data
- **SQL Server Express:** Used to store and manage the data warehouse
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):** To write SQL queries and manage databases
- **Git & GitHub:** For version control and showcasing the project
- **DrawIO:** To design data architecture diagrams

## 🚀 Project Objective

The goal of this project was to build a modern data warehouse system using SQL Server to analyze sales data.

### Key Points:

- **Source Data:** Two datasets from ERP and CRM systems in CSV format
- **Data Cleaning:** Fixing data quality issues before analysis
- **Integration:** Merging both datasets into a clean, easy-to-use model
- **Scope:** The project focuses on the most recent data (no historical data)
- **Documentation:** All models and processes are documented for easy understanding
